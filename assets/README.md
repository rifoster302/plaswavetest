About: 

PlasWave is a free, web-based application that connects plasma donors with clinics that are willing to pay them for their generosity. 

Did you know that approximately 90% of the earth can't meet their own plasma requirements for treating disease? 53% of the world doesn't even collect their own plasma- they rely entirely on imports. And despite comprising only 5% of the global population, the United States provides 70% of the world's imported blood plasma.

Why? Because the US (and a handful of other countries) are willing to pay donors for their plasma.

Compensated plasma donation has developed a stigma around it in the medical ethics community; paid donation is sometimes viewed as ethically ambiguous despite being one of the primary reasons the global demand for plasma is met. 

Any collection site listed on PlasWave is a for-profit donation center. Donors can use the app to easily find the closest sites and best compensation rates for their goodwill. The larger aim of this project is to increase the number of plasma donors in the US to meet rising global demand, and reward those generous people as well they deserve.

**This is the beta version of PlasWave. I had the idea for the app during an ethics class at Georgetown, and bringing the idea to life has been a longstanding personal goal of mine. The complete version of the app will host all paid donation sites in the US and update monthly with new incentive programs, as available.**

Function:

PlasWave opens by asking for the user's location to orient them to the nearest donation sites. The app then prompts the user with a basic donation-eligibility questionnaire that must be answered correctly to proceed. After answering correctly, the user can access the PlasWave map and click on individual sites to see location information and compensation rates. In the bottom left corner, there is a notification bell that provides the user with "FAQs" about the app and plasma donation. There is an inactive profile button in the top right of the application- in future versions of this app, users will be able to optionally create a profile to more easily track their appointments and continually optimize their donation schedules.
